   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   ```

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

    a. `app/src/data/resume.tsx`
    b. `app/page.tsx`
    c. `app/icon.tsx`

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
